High-Pressure Impact Rain Sprinkler
(aka You-Know-What) – 3D Printable Prototype
📌 Overview

This repository contains the complete mechanical design and simulation of a high-pressure impact rain sprinkler, developed as a 3D-printable functional prototype.

The project focuses on:

Mechanical robustness under pressure

Structural integrity analysis (FEA)

Design optimization for additive manufacturing

The model was fully assembled and validated using static structural simulation, ensuring the design can withstand realistic operating conditions.

🛠️ Key Features

Fully parametric 3D CAD model

Designed for high-pressure water impact

Tripod-based support structure for stability

Optimized for FDM / SLA 3D printing

Stress & strain validated using Finite Element Analysis (FEA)

🔬 Engineering Analysis

Simulation type: Static Structural

Result shown: Equivalent Static Strain

Max strain: ~2.09 × 10⁻⁴

Deformation scale: Amplified for visualization

📊 The analysis confirms that critical stress and strain concentrations remain within safe limits for common engineering plastics and lightweight metals.
